#Here is a short tutorial to help you jumpstart your journey on numbers 


print (10 % 3) #returns remainder of 10 divided by 3

print (10 % 2) #returns remainder of 10 divided by 2
my_num=-7
print(str(my_num) + " is my favourite number")
print(abs(my_num)) #returns absolute value of my_num
print(pow(my_num,2)) #raises my_num to the power of two
print(max(my_num,200)) #returns the larger value of the two 
print(min(my_num,200))

#heres a library of some sort for python for math that one can import this is how it is done
#syntax
from math import * #this enables us to use get more functions
#eg
print(floor(6.789)) #it rounds down to nearest whole number
print(ceil(6.789)) #fn that does opp of floor
print(round(6.789)) #fn that rounds off a number
print(sqrt(900)) #fn that gets square root of a number
